## 1. What are Skills?

Skills are plain Markdown (`.md`) files stored in `airecon/proxy/skills/`. They contain specialized knowledge about attack techniques, tool usage, and testing procedures for specific technologies or vulnerability classes.

**Skills complement the system prompt.** The system prompt gives the agent general security methodology. Skills provide deep, specific knowledge on-demand — without bloating the main prompt with information that is irrelevant to most targets.

**Examples of what skills contain:**
- Step-by-step testing checklists for a specific vulnerability (e.g., SQLi, SSRF)
- Exact tool commands for a specific technology (e.g., GraphQL introspection, Firebase rules)
- Payload collections tailored to a specific attack surface
- Knowledge about a specific framework's security model (e.g., Next.js server actions, FastAPI auth)

---

## 2. How Skills Work Internally

### 2.1 Discovery at startup

When AIRecon starts, `system.py` scans the entire `skills/` tree and builds a list of all `.md` files with their absolute paths:

```python
# airecon/proxy/system.py
def _load_local_skills() -> str:
    skills_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent / "skills"
    for path in sorted(skills_dir.rglob("*.md")):
        parts.append(f"- {path.absolute().as_posix()}")
```

This list is injected into the system prompt as an `<available_skills>` block:

```
<available_skills>
You have access to the following skill documents. If you need specific guidance
on a topic, use the `read_file` tool with the EXACT absolute path listed below:
- /home/user/.../airecon/proxy/skills/vulnerabilities/xss.md
- /home/user/.../airecon/proxy/skills/vulnerabilities/sqli.md
- /home/user/.../airecon/proxy/skills/protocols/graphql.md
...
</available_skills>
```

### 2.2 On-demand loading by the agent

The agent does **not** preload skill content into its context. Skills are loaded on demand using the `read_file` tool:

```
# Agent calls:
read_file(path="/absolute/path/to/skills/vulnerabilities/ssrf.md")
```

The agent decides to read a skill when:
- It detects a relevant technology in scan results (e.g., `whatweb` returns "GraphQL")
- It encounters a vulnerability class it wants detailed guidance on
- The user prompt references a specific topic (e.g., "test for JWT issues")
- A tool output contains keywords that match a skill topic

### 2.3 Why this design?

Loading all skills at startup would consume 50,000+ tokens of context window — wasted on irrelevant content for most targets. On-demand loading means the agent only pays the context cost for skills it actually needs.

## 4. Creating a Custom Skill

### Step 1: Choose the right category

| Your skill is about... | Folder |
|-----------------------|--------|
| A specific vulnerability class | `skills/vulnerabilities/` |
| A web framework | `skills/frameworks/` |
| A backend technology or SaaS | `skills/technologies/` |
| A protocol (GraphQL, WebSocket, gRPC, AD) | `skills/protocols/` |
| Recon methodology / SOP | `skills/reconnaissance/` |
| Payload collections | `skills/payloads/` |
| Tool usage guide | `skills/tools/` |

### Step 2: Create the file

```bash
# Example: adding a WebSocket testing skill
touch airecon/proxy/skills/protocols/websocket.md
```

### Step 3: Write the skill (see [Full Template](#6-full-skill-template) below)

### Step 4: Restart AIRecon

Skills are scanned at startup. Restart for the new file to appear in the `<available_skills>` list.

```bash
# Stop current session and restart
airecon start
```

### Step 5: Verify

Ask the agent to check a relevant target. When it detects the relevant technology, it should read your skill. You can also manually trigger it:

```
# In the TUI, type:
read the websocket skill and test this target for WebSocket vulnerabilities
```

## 5. Skill Writing Guidelines

### DO: Be specific and actionable

```markdown
# Good
Run: `python3 /home/pentester/tools/jwt_tool/jwt_tool.py <token> -X a`
This tests the alg:none bypass — if it succeeds, the server accepts unsigned tokens.

# Bad
"Test the JWT implementation for common vulnerabilities."
```

### DO: Include exact commands with real flags

```markdown
# Good
`subfinder -d <target> -all -recursive -o output/subdomains.txt`

# Bad
"Use subfinder to find subdomains."
```

### DO: Explain what success looks like

```markdown
**Success indicator:** Response changes from 403 to 200, or user data from a different account appears in the response body.
```

### DO: Keep payloads focused — 5 representative ones, not 50

```markdown
# Good (5 payloads covering different bypass patterns)
```sql
' OR 1=1--
' OR '1'='1
admin'--
' UNION SELECT NULL--
1; DROP TABLE users--
```

### DON'T: Write generic advice

```markdown
# Bad — this is already in the system prompt
"Test all endpoints for injection vulnerabilities."
```

### DON'T: Add lengthy prose explanations

Skills go into context window. Every word costs tokens. If something is already covered by general security knowledge, skip it.

### DON'T: Add more than one vulnerability class per file

Split `sql_and_nosql_injection.md` into `sql_injection.md` and `nosql_injection.md`. The agent searches for specific skills — mixing topics makes skills harder to locate and use efficiently.

**Trigger condition:** <When should the agent load this skill? What observation in scan output indicates this skill is relevant?>

## Overview
<2–3 sentences max. What is this vulnerability/technology and why does it matter for security testing?>

## Detection

## 7. Testing Your Skill

After creating a skill, verify it works as expected:

**1. Check it appears in the skill list:**

```bash
# Start AIRecon and look at the system prompt (dev mode)
python3 -c "
from airecon.proxy.system import get_system_prompt
p = get_system_prompt()
# Find the available_skills block
start = p.find('<available_skills>')
end = p.find('</available_skills>') + len('</available_skills>')
print(p[start:end])
"
```

**2. Test the read_file path directly:**

```bash
# Find the exact absolute path AIRecon will use
python3 -c "
from pathlib import Path
import airecon.proxy.system as sp
skills_dir = Path(sp.__file__).resolve().parent / 'skills'
for p in sorted(skills_dir.rglob('*.md')):
    if 'your_skill_name' in str(p):
        print(p.absolute().as_posix())
"
```

**3. Manually trigger in the TUI:**

```
# Type in the TUI:
read the skill at /absolute/path/to/your/skill.md and summarize it
```

If the agent reads and summarizes it correctly, the skill is working.
